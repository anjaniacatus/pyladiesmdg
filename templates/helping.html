               How does an organization like PyLadies happen? With help
          </p>
          <p>
             We're looking for event speakers and hosts, donations of time (ie. as a TA or mentor) or material goods (like event refreshments and funds). If you love coding in Python, we're excited to meet you! (Mila avadika teny vazah..)
           </p>
           <p>
             We are passionate about creating spaces for women to share their personal and professional projects, work collaboratively, and create Python focused workshops to continue our learning. Preparing for a conference or looking for a PyLadies social outing? Go no further! PyLadies of all backgrounds and skills are welcome, from n00b to hacker we want to get to know you! We welcome all, men and women alike, that uphold our Code of Conduct.
